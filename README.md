# Project: Movie Trailer Website
### by Ankit Kumar

Movie trailer website project, part of the Udacity [Full Stack Web Developer
Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004).

## Project Overview

You will write server-side code to store a list of your favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. You will then use your code to generate a static web page allowing visitors to browse their movies and watch the trailers.

## What will I Learn?

You will learn how to write an application using object-oriented Python. You will then learn how to make this application serve HTML via a web server.

## Required Libraries and Dependencies

Python 2.x is required to run this project. The Python executable should be in
your default path, which the Python installer should have set.

## Project contents

This project consists following files to run the code:

* entertainment_center.py - main Python script to run
* media.py - contains the class Movie that stores movie details
* fresh_tomatoes.py - module has a function called open_movies_page that takes in one argument, which is a list of movies, and creates an HTML file which will display all of your favorite movies.

## How to Run Project

Download the project zip file to you computer and unzip the file. Or clone this
repository to your desktop.

Open Python IDLE which we have installed earlier and then open entertainment_center.py file.

Run the entertainment_center.py file by pressing F5 key or simply from menu bar.

Your default browser should launch a new tab displaying the movie trailer website.
